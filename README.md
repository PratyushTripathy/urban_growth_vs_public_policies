### Abstract

While the process of China’s urbanization occurred during the early stages favored large cities, recent urban policies provided opportunities for smaller cities to grow. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic urban growth patterns and investigate key driving forces of land expansion in Jiaxing, China, a small city with rising economic power. Two simulation models, the Machine Learning model and the SLEUTH Cellular Automata model, are employed to test planning policies-informed urban growth scenarios from 2021 to 2040. Then spatial-temporal analytics are performed to identify patterns of urban transformation under different scenarios, considering the environment characteristic of Jiaxing, we chose the water body with different buffers to be the protected area. The results show that different levels of water protection policy have diverse spatial sensitivity on urban growth. For example, the 100 m water buffer scenario generates new urban growth areas in locations different from the 500 m scenario. Moreover, policies have diverse temporal sensitivity for different simulation models on urban growth. For example, the ML model forced by population capacity has more obvious implications in immigration policy than the SLEUTH CA model. The paper contributes to the existing studies of urban growth modeling in the following ways: (1) Comparing results from the ML model and the SLEUTH CA model; (2) Focusing on a less studied small city with water protection policy informed scenarios; (3) Providing a robust assessment using more recent data. Even though the study area is in China, we aim to offer opportunities for knowledge exchange in small cities around the globe.
